# Events / What are events?


- Events are custom attributes you can register on a component.
- Events are triggered by the user or the browser.
- Events are passed to a component similar to how HTML attributes are passed to HTML elements.

```vue
<template>
  <button @click="increment">Increment</button>
</template>
```
