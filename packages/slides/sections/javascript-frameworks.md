# Javascript Frameworks / Why?

- Frameworks provide a structure and tools for building complex applications.
- Traditional website design treated pages as documents, while modern apps need dynamic and responsive interfaces.
- Frameworks like Backbone and Angular abstract away DOM manipulation and event handling, letting developers focus on app logic.
- Component-based architecture and reactive state management simplify building and maintaining large-scale applications.
